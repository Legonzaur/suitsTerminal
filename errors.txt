Known issues:
- advancedTerminalMenu bindings can/will conflict with other mods that add shortcuts to the menu such as fastswitchplayerview and darmuhsTerminalStuff
- advancedTerminalMenu mirror cam preview will not automatically enable with darmuhsTerminalStuff (can still toggle after pressing the binding a few times)
